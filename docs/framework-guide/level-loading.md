# Level loading

Gameplay is consistently run from [Root.tscn](https://github.com/gd-azalea/azalea/blob/main/scenes/framework/Root.tscn). This default scene initializes essential components such as the GUI, Player, Weather, and Day/Night Cycle. Importantly, it contains a `üåè Level` node, where the active level is loaded as a child node.

This setup allows for persistent audio and GUI elements across different scenes, minimizing noticeable transitions and hard cuts during level loading.

All levels should be stored in `res://scenes/levels/` for quick and easy name-based lookups.

## Scene Loading Process
Loading a new scene involves the following steps:

- Fading to black.
- Loading the scene file.
- Adding the new scene as a child node.
- Removing the previous scene node.
- Spawning the player in the correct position.

The primary class responsible for this process is SceneLoader. You can load a level with the following call:

``` gdscript
SceneLoader.load(get_tree(), "MyLevelName")
```

Additionally, you have the option to keep the previous level in memory by using a flag. This is useful for scenarios like transitioning between the interior and exterior of a building. By retaining the larger exterior scene in memory, returning outside becomes nearly instantaneous since it was never fully unloaded.
