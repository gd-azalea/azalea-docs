# Mods

I want to integrate <https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader> for mod support.

However this is currently broken for Godot 4.2, and depends on the following issues to be resolved:

- <https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader/issues/315>
- <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/83542>
- <https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader/issues/345>
